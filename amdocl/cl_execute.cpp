/*! \brief Enqueue a command to execute a kernel on a device.
 *
 *  \param command_queue is a valid command-queue. The kernel  will  be  queued
 *  for execution on the device associated with \a command_queue.
 *
 *  \param kernel is a valid kernel object. The OpenCL context associated  with
 *  \a kernel and \a command-queue must be the same.
 *
 *  \param work_dim is the number of dimensions  used  to  specify  the  global
 *  work-items and work-items in the work-group.  \a work_dim  must  be greater
 *  than zero and less than or equal to three.
 *
 *  \param global_work_offset must currently be  a  NULL  value.  In  a  future
 *  revision of OpenCL, \a global_work_offset can be used to specify  an  array
 *  of \a work_dim unsigned values that describe the offset used  to  calculate
 *  the global ID of a work-item instead of having the global IDs always  start
 *  at offset (0, 0, 0).
 *
 *  \param global_work_size points to an array of \a work_dim  unsigned  values
 *  that describe the number of global work-items  in  \a  work_dim  dimensions
 *  that will  execute  the  kernel  function.   The  total  number  of  global
 *  work-items is computed as global_work_size[0] * ...
 *  * global_work_size[work_dim - 1].
 *
 *  \param local_work_size points to an array of \a  work_dim  unsigned  values
 *  that describe the number of work-items that  make  up  a  work-group  (also
 *  referred to as the size of the work-group)  that  will  execue  the  kernel
 *  specified by kernel.
 *
 *  \param num_events_in_wait_list specifies the number of event objects in
 *  \a event_wait_list
 *
 *  \param event_wait_list specifies events that need to complete  before  this
 *  particular command can be executed. If  \a event_wait_list  is  NULL,  then
 *  this particular command does not wait on any event to complete.
 *  If \a event_wait_list is NULL, \a num_events_in_wait_list must be 0.
 *  If \a event_wait_list is not NULL, the list of events pointed to by
 *  \a event_wait_list must be valid and \a num_events_in_wait_list must be
 *  greater than 0. The events specified in \a event_wait_list act as
 *  synchronization points.
 *
 *  \param event returns an event object that identifies this particular kernel
 *  execution instance. Event objects are unique and can be used to identify  a
 *  particular kernel execution instance later on.  If \a  event  is  NULL,  no
 *  event will be created for this kernel execution instance and  therefore  it
 *  will not be possible for the application to query or queue a wait for  this
 *  particular kernel execution instance.
 *
 *  The total number of work-items in a work-group is computed as
 *  local_work_size[0] * ... * local_work_size[work_dim - 1].
 *  The total number of work-items in the work-group must be less than or equal
 *  to the CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE. The explicitly specified
 *  \a local_work_size will be used to determine how to break the global  work-
 *  items specified by global_work_size into appropriate work-group  instances.
 *  If \a local_work_size is specified, the values specified in
 *  \a global_work_size[0], ...,  global_work_size[work_dim - 1] must be evenly
 *  divisable by the corresponding values specified in  \a  local_work_size[0],
 *  ..., local_work_size[work_dim - 1]. \a local_work_size can also be  a  NULL
 *  value in which case the OpenCL implementation  will  determine  how  to  be
 *  break the global work-items into appropriate work-groups.
 *
 *  If \a local_work_size is NULL and no work-group size is specified when  the
 *  kernel is compiled, the OpenCL implementation will determine how  to  break
 *  the global work-items specified  by  \a  global_work_size into  appropriate
 *  work-group instances. The work-group size to be used for kernel can also be
 *  specified in the program source using the
 *  __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) qualifier. In this case  the
 *  size of work group specified by \a  local_work_size must  match  the  value
 *  specified by the \a reqd_work_group_size attribute qualifier.
 *
 *  These  work-group  instances  are  executed  in  parallel  across  multiple
 *  compute units or concurrently on the  same  compute  unit.  Each  work-item
 *  is  uniquely identified by a global identifier. The global ID, which can be
 *  read inside the kernel is computed using the value given by
 *  \a global_work_size and \a global_work_offset.
 *
 *  \return One of the following values:
 *
 *  - CL_SUCCESS if the kernel execution was successfully queued
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE if there is no successfully  built  program
 *    executable available for device associated with \a command_queue.
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE if \a command_queue is not a valid command-queue
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_KERNEL if \a kernel is not a valid kernel object.
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_CONTEXT if context associated with command_queue and kernel are
 *    not the same or if the context associated with command_queue and events in
 *    event_wait_list are not the same.
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_KERNEL_ARGS if the kernel argument values have not been
 *    specified or are not valid for the device on which kernel will be
 *    executed.
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_WORK_DIMENSION if \a work_dim is not a valid value
 *    (i.e. a value between 1 and 3).
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_WORK_GROUP_SIZE if \a local_work_size is specified and  number
 *    of workitems specified by \a global_work_size is not evenly divisable  by
 *    size of work-given by \a local_work_size or does not match the work-group
 *    size specified for kernel using the
 *    __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) qualifier in program
 *    source.
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_GLOBAL_OFFSET if \a global_work_offset is not NULL.
 *
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to queue the execution instance
 *    of \a kernel on  the  command-queue  because  of  insufficient  resources
 *    needed to execute the  kernel.  For  example,  the  explicitly  specified
 *    \a local_work_dim in range causes a failure to execute the kernel because
 *    of insufficient resources such as  registers  or  local  memory.  Another
 *    example would be the number of read-only image args used in kernel exceed
 *    the CL_DEVICE_MAX_READ_IMAGE_ARGS value  for  device  or  the  number  of
 *    write-only image args used in kernel exceed the
 *    CL_DEVICE_MAX_WRITE_IMAGE_ARGS value for device or the number of samplers
 *    used in kernel exceed CL_DEVICE_MAX_SAMPLERS for device.
 *
 *  - CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE if there is a failure to allocate memory
 *    for image or buffer objects specified as arguments to kernel.
 *
 *  - CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST if \a event_wait_list is NULL and
 *    \a num_events_in_wait_list > 0, or \a event_wait_list is not NULL and
 *    \a num_events_in_wait_list is 0, or if event objects in
 *    \a event_wait_list are not valid events.
 *
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources
 *    required by the runtime.

 *  \addtogroup CL_Order Out of order Execution of Kernels and Memory Commands
 *
 *  The OpenCL functions that are submitted to a command-queue are queued in
 *  the order the calls are made but can be configured to execute in-order or
 *  out-of-order. The properties argument in clCreateCommandQueue can be used
 *  to specify the execution order.
 *
 *  If the CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE property of a command-queue
 *  is not set, the commands queued to a command-queue execute in order.
 *  For example, if an application calls clEnqueueNDRangeKernel to execute
 *  kernel A followed by a clEnqueueNDRangeKernel to execute kernel B,
 *  the application can assume that kernel A finishes first and then kernel B
 *  is executed. If the memory objects output by kernel A are inputs to kernel B
 *  then kernel B will see the correct data in memory objects produced
 *  by execution of kernel A. If the CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE
 *  property of a commandqueue is set, then there is no guarantee that kernel A
 *  will finish before kernel B starts execution.
 *
 *  Applications can configure the commands queued to a command-queue to
 *  execute out-of-order by setting the CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE
 *  property of the commandqueue.  This can be specified when the command-queue
 *  is created or can be changed dynamically using clSetCommandQueueProperty.
 *  In out-of-order execution mode there is no guarantee that the queued
 *  commands will finish execution in the order they were queued. As there is
 *  no guarantee that kernels will be executed in order i.e. based on when
 *  the clEnqueueNDRangeKernel calls are made within a command-queue, it is
 *  therefore possible that an earlier clEnqueueNDRangeKernel call to execute
 *  kernel A identified by event A may execute and/or finish later than a
 *  clEnqueueNDRangeKernel call to execute kernel B which was called by the
 *  application at a later point in time. To guarantee a specific order of
 *  execution of kernels, a wait on a particular event (in this case event A)
 *  can be used. The wait for event A can be specified in the event_wait_list
 *  argument to clEnqueueNDRangeKernel for kernel B.
 *
 *  In addition, a wait for events or a barrier function can be queued to the
 *  command-queue. The wait for events command ensures that previously queued
 *  commands identified by the list of events to wait for have finished before
 *  the next batch of commands is executed. The barrier ensures that all
 *  previously queued commands in a command-queue have finished execution
 *  before the next batch of commands is executed.
 *
 *  Similarly, commands to read, write, copy or map memory objects that are
