/*! \brief Allocate a shared virtual memory buffer that can be shared by the
 * host and all devices in an OpenCL context.
 *
 *  \param context is a valid OpenCL context used to create the SVM buffer.
 *
 *  \param flags is a bit-field that is used to specify allocation and usage
 *  information. If CL_MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER is not specified, the
 *  buffer is created as a coarse grained SVM allocation. Similarly, if
 *  CL_MEM_SVM_ATOMICS is not specified, the buffer is created without
 *  support for SVM atomic operations.
 *
 *  \param size is the size in bytes of the SVM buffer to be allocated.
 *
 *  \param alignment is the minimum alignment in bytes that is required for the
 *  newly created buffer?s memory region. It must be a power of two up to the
 *  largest data type supported by the OpenCL device. For the full profile, the
 *  largest data type is long16. For the embedded profile, it is long16 if the
 *  device supports 64-bit integers; otherwise it is int16. If alignment is 0, a
 *  default alignment will be used that is equal to the size of largest data
 *  type supported by the OpenCL implementation.
 *
 *  \return A valid non-NULL shared virtual memory address if the SVM buffer
 *  is successfully allocated. Otherwise, like malloc, it returns a NULL pointer
 *  value. clSVMAlloc will fail if
 *  - \a context is not a valid context.
 *  - \a flags does not contain CL_MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER but does
 *  contain CL_MEM_SVM_ATOMICS.
 *  - Values specified in \a flags do not follow rules for that particular type.
 *  - CL_MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER or CL_MEM_SVM_ATOMICS is specified
 *  in \a flags and these are not supported by at least one device in
 *  \a context.
 *  - The values specified in \a flags are not valid.
 *  - \a size is 0 or > CL_DEVICE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE value for any device in
 *  \a context.
 *  - \a alignment is not a power of two or the OpenCL implementation cannot
 *  support the specified alignment for at least one device in \a context.
 *  - There was a failure to allocate resources.
